# Aquasentinel (AI_lifeguard)

## This is my team's project, the Aquasentinal, aka, the AI lifeguard. This is a machine learning, computer vision model that detects dangers in and around water with a 92% accuracy.
This is a student-led project that aims to tackle to growing problem of dangers in and around bodies of water. This model detects 3 classes of dangers using object detection: Active drowning (conscious drowning), Passive drowning (Unconscious drowning), and running on the pool deck. Some features of our project include:
* Upload Feature
* Webcam/Surveillance feature
* Advised course of action in emergency
* Newsletter

## Quick Summary
Users have the capability to upload an image of a pool or beach scene to the website. 
The model has the ability to:
* identify individuals who are actively or passively drowning in the water
* detect instances of children running on the pool deck
* Provide guidance on appropriate actions to take based on the image, such as providing assistance to a swimmer in distress

## Potential Roadblocks
* The glare from the sun could mess with the model's ability to detect dangers in the water.
* This model may have difficulty detecting certain dangers in overpopulated pools or blurry input/uploads 
* The model may not be able to tell the difference between someone holding their breath and someone drowning 
* The model does not contain a motion detector.
